Hello. Would you like to create a new portfolio?
What strategy would you like to implement for your Omni portfolio?

**聊天记录（蓝色气泡，用户输入）：**
Create a portfolio called Omni with an initial value of $10,000
I want a SMA crossover strategy on TQQQ. I want a take profit strategy, but no stop losses – I'm bullish on tech long-term and don't want to be stop lossed out. I also want to space out my buys and not go all-in at once.

**描述框（灰色大框）：**
Description:
The "Omni" portfolio is initialized with an initial investment of $10,000 and employs a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy on TQQQ. This strategy is designed to capitalize on upward trends by spacing out purchases rather than investing the entire amount at once. Specifically, the portfolio buys increments of TQQQ when the short-term SMA (50-day) crosses above the long-term SMA (200-day), indicating a bullish trend. Additionally, the strategy includes a take profit mechanism that sells all TQQQ positions when the Price Rate of Change over a 14-day period exceeds 15%, allowing for the realization of profits without implementing stop-loss measures. This approach reflects a long-term bullish outlook on TQQQ, focusing on momentum and profit-taking.
